All Configurable Options Module for Magento by outer/edge

This module will show all available options that are available for a configurable product, regardless of stock levels for the associated products. For example, if you have a clothing item available in three sizes - **Small**, **Medium** and **Large**, and the **Small** size is out of stock, Magento would not show this option. However, with this module all options will be displayed, but out of stock items will be disabled.
